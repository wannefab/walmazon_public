Time to shine full-stackers!! 

A full stack project has to be build in a week and now you are all by your own. 

But don't worry about the work load because now the concept of reusability will be finally applied.

This project is about have aws many features as possible so don't worry about perfectionism.

## Technology used

Same as last project:
* React.js && (MaterialUI || BlueprintJS)
* Spring && H2 || Node && Express && (PostgreSQL || MongoDB)
